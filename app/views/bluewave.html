The duration of each call is to be calculated in one-minute increments and rounded up to the nearest one-minute increment for any fraction of minutes used. If the computed charge for a call includes a fraction of a cent, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Subject to the provisions below.&nbsp; The Unlimited calling plan only includes calls made within the United States. As noted therein, certain types of calls, including but not limited to some mobile phones and premium rate phones, will not be included in the unlimited calls program, and will be billed in accordance with these terms.</p>
        <p><strong>3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International rates.</strong>&nbsp;When Customer dials an international PSTN phone number or mobile phone number, charges may apply regardless of whether the party on the other line answers the call. Calls made by a Customer to an international mobile or premium rate international telephone number may result in higher toll charges. International rates vary by destination country, city, and band, and are subject to change by Kotter from time-to-time without prior notice. You will be charged for all calls to any international destination, excluding inclusive countries, in full-minute increments at Kotter’s then-current rate as posted at www.kotter.net.

        <p>4.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Compliance with Law.</strong>&nbsp; Customer is required to use the Service in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation, all state, federal and international: (a) Do-Not-Call (“DNC”) list prohibitions; (b) telemarketer licensing and bonding requirements; (c) consumer cancellation rights; (d) mandatory disclosures; (e) wireless calling restrictions; (f) restrictions on the use of automatic telephone dialing systems, pre-recorded messages, and soundboard technology; (g) internal opt-out rules; (h) intellectual property rights and restrictions; and (i) other product and industry specific rules and disclosures.&nbsp; By making any use of the Service, Customer expressly warrants to Kotter that Customer is and shall continue to act in full compliance with the law. All Kotter offers are void where prohibited by law. Customer has read, understands, and will comply with the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”), the Federal Communication Commission’s (“FCC”) Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), and all other applicable laws and regulations. Customer has reviewed these rules with Customer’s own legal counsel to ensure that Customer understands and is fully compliant.&nbsp; Kotter does not assume responsibility for ensuring that Customer’s marketing campaigns meet applicable legal requirements. Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold Kotter harmless, if Customer is ever held guilty or liable for any violation of the law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer agrees that Kotter has and is taking active steps to ensure the compliance of its customers, including by having Customer agree to these terms and otherwise. If Kotter discovers evidence that Customer has or may have violated the law, Kotter may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate the Customer’s use of the Service immediately.&nbsp; Customer agrees that Kotter may disclose information which relates to Customer in order to comply with a judicial order, governmental order or otherwise as required by law.</p>

Kotter reserves the right, but is not required, to take any and all action it deems appropriate (including blocking access to particular calling numbers or geographic areas) to prevent or terminate any fraud or abuse in connection with the Service, or any use thereof, provided, however, that any such action shall be consistent with applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations and provided further that the failure to take any such action shall not limit Customer’s responsibility for all usage of the Service.</p>

        <p><strong>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ownership.</strong>&nbsp;Any telephone number provided by Kotter to the Customer (“Number”) shall be leased and not sold. Kotter reserves the right to change, cancel or move the Number at its sole discretion. Where customer wishes to port in telephone number(s) for use with the Service, Customer should NOT cancel service with the current/previous service provider(s) until Kotter confirms to Customer that the numbers have been successfully ported to Kotter. Customer is responsible for the timely termination of all services with current/previous service provider and the settlement of any charges owed to their current/previous service provider. Additionally, Customer is responsible for the verification that the Number(s) provided to Customer meet the necessary requirements of Customer (i.e., such Number will be considered a local number to Customer in Customer’s area or such number is sufficiently different from a customer competitor’s number, etc.). Kotter will reasonably accommodate Customer with a particular number selection, prefix or sequence, as available and able to accommodate. Kotter accepts no responsibility or liability in the number ultimately issued or selected for the Service.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing.</strong>&nbsp;Customer’s Number will likely NOT be listed in any local or regional telephone book unless Customer has taken independent steps to pay for telephone number or business advertisement. Numbers associated with the Service are not utilized with a traditional wire line/carrier. Kotter makes no warranty and accepts no responsibility or liability for Customer’s Number(s) NOT being listed in telephone books or other directories.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Porting.</strong>&nbsp;Customer’s porting away of a telephone number does not extinguish Customer’s obligations and/or limitations under this Agreement, including the notice requirements contained herein.</p>

At any time that Kotter is required to perform emergency or un-planned maintenance, Kotter will make reasonable efforts to notify the account contact that has been listed by the Customer under the “Options” tab of Customer’s online administrative control panel or via email to such Customer email address on file. However, at times, emergency or un-planned maintenance may have to be done before Kotter can give any notice to Customer.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, Kotter will not be liable (under this Agreement or any uptime service agreement) for service interruptions where maintenance is prudent to perform.</p>

Kotter reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, what constitutes misuse of the Service and Customer agrees that Kotter’s determination is final and binding on Customer. Kotter may charge an activation fee to reactivate a terminated service. Additionally, in the event of termination due to a Customer breach, Customer shall remain fully obligated for the payment of all taxes, fees, and charges for Service ordered for the remainder of the billing cycle.</p>
        <p><strong>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination Charges.</strong>&nbsp;Upon Termination, in addition to any outstanding balance incurred or due on your account, Customer shall pay the full amount of the monthly recurring charges for the terminated Service for the month of the effective termination (regardless of whether the termination date is mid-billing cycle), in addition to any additional charges incurred under this Agreement. You agree that Kotter may charge such unpaid balance to the Credit Card.</p>
        <p><strong>7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liability after Termination.</strong>&nbsp;Termination or expiration of this Agreement will not extinguish Customer’s obligations or liability arising prior to such termination or expiration.

        <p><strong>8.2.2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kotter shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any third party action alleging that the use of any Service, or any part thereof, in combination with products not supplied by Kotter infringes any third party intellectual property right provided that the infringement is (a) due solely to the combination and use of such products together, if the use of the Service independent of any product not supplied by Kotter would not have given rise to the claim; or (b) Customer is advised by Kotter either directly or by means of Documentation, marketing or other published materials that the use of Kotter Service in tandem with such products represents a risk of infringement; and (c) Customer combines and uses such products with Kotter’s Service in contravention of Kotter’s disclaimer.</p>
