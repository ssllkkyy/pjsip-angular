Other fees may apply for usage of e911 service as outlined herein.</p>
        <p><strong>3.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulatory Recovery Fee.</strong>&nbsp;A Regulatory Recovery Fee of 5% of all monthly recurring charges will be charged monthly to offset costs incurred by Kotter in complying with inquiries and obligations imposed by federal, state and municipal regulatory bodies/governments and the related legal and billing expenses. The Regulatory Recovery Fee will apply to every phone number assigned, including toll free and virtual numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toll Charges.</strong>&nbsp;Every call to or from Equipment using the Service that originates or terminates in the Public Switched Telephone Network (“PSTN”), including other VoIP networks and inbound toll free number calls to Customer’s toll free number (if applicable), is considered a Toll Call. The duration of each call is to be calculated in one-minute increments and rounded up to the nearest one-minute increment for any fraction of minutes used. If the computed charge for a call includes a fraction of a cent, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Subject to the provisions below.&nbsp; The Unlimited calling plan only includes calls made within the United States. As noted therein, certain types of calls, including but not limited to some mobile phones and premium rate phones, will not be included in the unlimited calls program, and will be billed in accordance with these terms.</p>
        <p><strong>3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International rates.</strong>&nbsp;When Customer dials an international PSTN phone number or mobile phone number, charges may apply regardless of whether the party on the other line answers the call. Calls made by a Customer to an international mobile or premium rate international telephone number may result in higher toll charges. International rates vary by destination country, city, and band, and are subject to change by Kotter from time-to-time without prior notice. You will be charged for all calls to any international destination, excluding inclusive countries, in full-minute increments at Kotter’s then-current rate as posted at www.kotter.net. Note that certain limitations apply to Customer’s ability to place calls to certain international destinations and types of phones, including but not limited to, satellite phones.

        <p><strong>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price Changes and other Modifications.</strong>&nbsp;Changes to charges, fees or taxes for the Service (other than international calling rates which are updated from time to time at&nbsp;<a href="https://kotter.net/international-rates" target="_blank"><strong>https://kotter.net/international-rates</strong></a>) are effective after fifteen (15) days’ notice has been sent to Customer via email to the authorized email address for Customer’s account.
